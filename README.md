## 🔍 Overview

This project automates report writing for applications and enrolment data. Excel reports are automated with Excel formulas. Data has been removed from Excel template files, copy data extracted from SIS onto templates. Briefing Note KPIs are calculated in Excel and generated using a Python variable mapping script. All KPIs are calculated using Excel formulas. If formula modification is required, it is recommended to maintain the use of COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, and LET formulas as much as possible. VBA scripts are used to control formula removal for final products based on cell protection (locked) status.
